You're a business analyst for Round Roasters, a coffee restaurant in the United States of America. 
The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can 
drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. Your job is to analyze the A/B test and 
write up a recommendation to whether the Round Roasters chain should launch this new menu.

In order to complete this project, you must be able to:

Cleanup, format, and blend a wide range of data sources
Plan and analyze A/B tests

Round Roasters is an upscale coffee chain with locations in the western United States of America. 
The past few years have resulted in stagnant growth at the coffee chain, and a new management team 
was put in place to reignite growth at their stores.

The first major growth initiative is to introduce gourmet sandwiches to the menu, along with limited wine offerings. 
The new management team believes that a television advertising campaign is crucial to drive people into the stores 
with these new offerings.

However, the television campaign will require a significant boost in the companyâ€™s marketing budget, 
with an unknown return on investment (ROI). Additionally, there is concern that current customers will 
not buy into the new menu offerings.

To minimize risk, the management team decides to test the changes in two cities with new television advertising. 
Denver and Chicago cities were chosen to participate in this test because the stores in these two cities (or markets)
perform similarly to all stores across the entire chain of stores; performance in these two markets would be a good proxy 
to predict how well the updated menu performs.
